i dont have like self doubt or something, its just like, throwing it into a black box, i dunno whats going to come out the other end, i guess ill know dec/jan

i wanna keep myself busy tho, i do want to work on those things and more, i can do it, the math i need to learn but i can do it

and then the biology of cancer etc i have to keep learning

the comp sci stuff, i have to keep on top of bc things change
